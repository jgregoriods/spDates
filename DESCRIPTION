Description: Analysis of Spatial Gradients in Radiocarbon Dates. Inspired by
    space-time regressions often performed to assess the expansion of the
    Neolithic from the Near East to Europe. Test for significant correlations
    between the (earliest) radiocarbon dates of archaeological sites and their
    respective distances from a hypothetical center of origin. Distances can be
    either great-circle or least-cost paths calculated from a friction surface.
    Both ordinary least squares (OLS) and reduced major axis (RMA) methods are
    supported. It is also possible to iterate over many sites to identify the
    most likely origin.
