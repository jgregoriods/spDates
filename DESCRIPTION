Description: Inspired by space-time regressions often performed to assess
    the expansion of the Neolithic from the Near East to Europe (Pinhasi et
    al. 2005 <doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.0030410>). Test for significant
    correlations between the (earliest) radiocarbon dates of archaeological
    sites and their respective distances from a hypothetical center of origin.
    Both ordinary least squares (OLS) and reduced major axis (RMA) methods
    are supported (Russell et al. 2014 <doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0087854>).
    It is also possible to iterate over many sites to identify the most likely
    origin.
