<h2>Analysis of Spatial Gradients in Radiocarbon Dates</h2>

Archaeologists interested in the expansion of cultural phenomena have often turned to time-space regressions as a first approach to exploring their data. In essence, one plots the radiocarbon ages of archaeological sites against their distances from a hypothetical origin. If a cultural advance has indeed taken place, the expectation is that radiocarbon dates will be more recent as one moves away from the center of origin. If a significant correlation is found, the intercept of the regression can be used as an estimate of the start date for the dispersal, while the regression slope provides an estimate of the speed of advance. Most applications have been focused on the Neolithic expansion from the Near East to Europe (Ammerman and Cavalli-Sforza 1971; Gkiasta et al. 2003; Pinhasi et al. 2005), but other case studies include the Paleolithic recolonization of Northern Europe (Fort et al. 2004), the Clovis expansion in North America (Hamilton and Buchanan 2007), the human colonization of the Americas from Asia (Hamilton and Buchanan 2010), the Lapita spread in Austronesia (Fort 2002), and the Bantu spread in Africa (Isern and Fort 2019).
